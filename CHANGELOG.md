# 2.2.0 (unreleased)

* Added method `Redis#without_reconnect` that ensures the client will not try
  to reconnect when running the code inside the specified block.

* Thread-safe by default. Thread safety can be explicitly disabled by passing
  `:thread_safe => false` as argument.

* Commands called inside a MULTI/EXEC no longer raise error replies, since a
  successful EXEC means the commands inside the block were executed.

* MULTI/EXEC blocks are pipelined.

* Don't disconnect on error replies.

* Use `IO#syswrite` instead of `IO#write` because write buffering is not
  necessary.

* Connect to a unix socket by passing the `:path` option as argument.

* The timeout value is coerced into a float, allowing sub-second timeouts.

* Accept both `:with_scores` _and_ `:withscores` as argument to sorted set
  commands.

* Use hiredis (0.3) when it is loaded.
